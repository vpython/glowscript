      <p class="Normal">VPython makes it unusually easy to write programs that generate navigable real-time 3D animations. It is based on the Python programming language which is widely used in introductory programming courses thanks to its clean design, and it is also widely used in science and business.</p>
      <p class="Normal">Classic VPython was originated by David Scherer in 2000. In 2011 David Scherer and Bruce Sherwood initiated the development of GlowScript, a similar programming environment but which runs in a browser. In 2014 it became possible to use RapydScript, a programming language very similar to Python, to support VPython programs in  the GlowScript  environment. This
        documentation describes the GlowScript version of VPython. There is also <a href="../GlowScriptDocs/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>technical documentation</strong></a> about the GlowScript environment, including how to use JavaScript or RapydScript for your programs.</p>
      <p class="Normal">There is a beta version of a new &quot;Jupyter&quot; VPython originated by John Coady in 2014 and currently under development by John Coady, Ruth Chabay, Bruce Sherwood, and Steve Spicklemire. It runs in a Jupyter notebook and uses GlowScript VPython syntax with standard Python, thereby providing access to standard Python modules. For details see<a href="http://vpython.org" target="_blank"> <strong>vpython.org</strong></a>. Also of interest is  a discussion about plans for the <a href="http://vpython.org/contents/announcements/evolution.html" target="_blank"><strong>future evolution</strong></a> of VPython.</p>
      <p class="Normal">For a quick introduction, see the following YouTube videos. These were created for Classic VPython but are just as useful for learning the more recent versions. </p>

      <p class="Normal"><strong>Be sure to explore the many GlowScript <a href="http://www.glowscript.org/#/user/GlowScriptDemos/folder/Examples/" target="_blank">example programs</a></strong>, written using JavaScript, CoffeeScript, RapydScript, or VPython. The VPython option is based on the <strong><a href="http://rapydscript.pyjeon.com/" target="_blank">RapydScript</a></strong> Python-to-JavaScript compiler. For most programs, RapydScript is nearly the same as Python, but there are differences which can be seen in the <a href="http://rapydscript.pyjeon.com/" target="_blank">RapydScript documentation</a>.</p>
      <p class="Normal"><span class="style1">CAUTION</span></p>
      <p class="Normal">Do not use &quot;wait&quot; as a variable name. All GlowScript languages (VPython, RapydScrpt, CoffeeScript, JavaScript) use &quot;wait&quot; as a special signal for the compilation process. In the VPython case this signal is inserted for you where needed.</p>
      <p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Normal"><span class="style1">For experienced programmers</span></p>
      <p class="Normal">As a convenience to novice programmers to provide everything that is needed to get started, GlowScript by default imports all of the VPython features and includes <a href="math.html">standard math functions</a> such as sqrt.</p>
<p class="Normal">You can  execute &quot;import vis&quot; or &quot;import visual&quot;, in which case you must refer to &quot;vis.color&quot; or &quot;visual.color&quot; for all VPython entities.</p>
<p class="Normal">Here is another way to  import selectively  from the  vis or visual module:</p>
<p class="program">from vis import box, color # or (box, color)<br />
  box(color=color.orange) </p>
<p class="Normal">The documentation is written as though &quot;from visual import *&quot; were present.</p>
      <div> </div>
      <p class="Normal"><span class="style1">For those who have used Classic VPython</span></p>
      <p class="Normal">The difference between RapydScript and VPython programs in the GlowScript context is that the VPython option attempts to mimic exactly the syntax and semantics of Classic VPython programs, whereas the RapydScript option implements the same semantics for 3D objects as that of JavaScript and CoffeeScript programs. For example, in a RapydScript program the sphere object has a size attribute but no radius attribute, and like box, the default size of the sphere is 1x1x1. Also, changing the length of the axis in a RapydScript program has no effect on the size (except for an arrow, which has a special axis_and_length attribute), but in a VPython program, as in Classic VPython, changing the length of the axis also changes the length of the object (the first component of the object's size).</p>
      <p class="Normal">GlowScript by default processes VPython programs as though they had the following  statements at the start of the program (which you don't need to include; they will be ignored):</p>
      <p class="program">from __future__ import division, print_function<br />
        from visual import *<br />
        from visual.graph import * </p>
      <div>
        <p class="Normal">GlowScript treats 3/2 as 1.5 as in Python 3.x, not 1 as in the Python 2.x language, and the print statement must take the Python 3.x form of print('hello') rather than the Python 2.x form of print 'hello'.</p>
      </div>
<p class="Normal">Many programs written in Classic <a href="http://vpython.org" target="_blank"><strong>VPython 6</strong></a> will run in GlowScript  without change after  being run through a <a href="../GlowScriptDocs/VPtoGS.py" target="_blank"><strong>conversion program</strong></a> written in Python. This  program converts<strong> (x,y,z) =&gt; vector(x,y,z)</strong> and <strong>obj.x =&gt; obj.pos.x</strong>. These changes are necessary because GlowScript does not recognize <strong>(x,y,z)</strong> as a vector nor <strong>obj.x</strong> as a shorthand for <strong>obj.pos.x</strong>. The program also converts <strong>display =&gt; canvas</strong> and <strong>gdisplay =&gt; graph</strong>.</p>
<p class="Normal"> In the GlowScript environment pos, size, axis, color, and up are all vectors, and they are somewhat special vectors that track changes in order to trigger correct rendering of the 3D scene when one of these object attributes changes. One result of this architecture is that <br />
  <br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ball.pos += vector(1,2,3)</strong><br />
  <br />
  must be rewritten as <br />
  <br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ball.pos = ball.pos + vector(1,2,3)</strong><br />
  <br />
  The conversion program makes these changes, and similar changes for -=, *=, and /=. The program also converts <strong>scene.mouse.getclick() =&gt; scene.waitfor('click')</strong>, which works in both environments.</p>
<p class="Normal">In GlowScript you can use the shorthand &quot;vec&quot; for &quot;vector&quot;. If you wish to use a GlowScript program containing &quot;vec&quot; in the Classic VPython environment, just add the statement &quot;vec = vector&quot; at the start of the program.</p>
<p class="Normal"><span class="style1">Limitations</span></p>
<p class="Normal">A few VPython objects are not currently available in  GlowScript: convex, faces, frame, and the 3D text object. The GlowScript objects <a href="../GlowScriptDocs/vector.html" target="_blank">vertex</a>, <a href="../GlowScriptDocs/triangle.html" target="_blank">triangle</a>, and <a href="../GlowScriptDocs/triangle.html" target="_blank">quad</a> represent a more powerful alternative to faces. Many applications of frame can be handled with the GlowScript <a href="../GlowScriptDocs/compound.html" target="_blank">compound</a> object.  The extrusion object (and the paths and shapes libraries) currently has many fewer features than the Classic version.</p>
<p class="Normal">One way to deal with differences is to check the elements of the &quot;version&quot; variable that is available in both Classic VPython and the GlowScript version and do different things in the different environments:</p>
<p class="program">Classic VPython: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version is ['X.Y', 'release']<br />
  GlowScript VPython: version is ['X.Y', 'glowscript']
</p>
<p class="Normal">The <a href="../GlowScriptDocs/curve.html">curve</a> and <a href="points.html">points</a> objects are somewhat different in the GlowScript environment, but with a little care it is possible to use these objects in such a way that they will also work in Classic VPython. Note that in GlowScript the list of points in a curve object is not a numpy array, so that a loop is required to change all of the points.</p>
<p class="Normal">To handle  <a href="mouse.html"><strong>mouse events</strong></a> one cannot use scene.getevent() but must use scene.bind(),  which is available both in Classic VPython 6 and in GlowScript. Also available are scene.pause() and scene.waitfor('click') and related options.</p>
<p class="Normal">It is possible in the GlowScript environment to place <strong><a href="../GlowScriptDocs/controls.html" target="_blank">widgets</a></strong> such as buttons or sliders on the web browser page, but the mechanism is that of HTML and jQuery, not the wxPython component of Classic VPython. Currently there isn't an easy way to display a button or slider in a way that will work both in the Classic VPython environment and in the GlowScript environment.  </p>
<p class="Normal">It is not possible to import arbitrary Python modules such as numpy, and any VPython program that uses numpy will have to be modifed. However, loops are fast in the JavaScript language to which GlowScript programs compile, so if you are using numpy solely for the speed of array manipulation, you may be able to replace a numpy calculation easily and efficiently with a loop.</p>
<p class="Normal"><span class="style1">Text output</span></p>
<p class="Normal">The print statement is similar to the Python print statement, but see the documentation on  additional <strong><a href="../GlowScriptDocs/text_output.html" target="_blank">text output capabilities</a></strong> available in the web browser environment.</p>
<p class="Normal"><span class="style1">Additional capabilities</span></p>
<p class="Normal">This VPython Help includes comments on additional capabilities offered by GlowScript that are not currently available in Classic VPython. You can use these features with the understanding that the resulting GlowScript program may not run in the Classic environment without modification. Examples include a more powerful form of faces (using vertex, triangle, and quad objects), compound objects that can be displayed very efficiently, and the ability to clone an object. The <a href="../GlowScriptDocs/trail.html" target="_blank">attach_trail</a> and <a href="../GlowScriptDocs/trail.html" target="_blank">attach_arrow</a> options are more powerful substitutes for the Classic VPython make_trail (which is also supported). The Jupyter version of VPython is designed to use the same syntax as GlowScript VPython.</p>
<p class="Normal">You can set the size attribute (or length, width, and height) of any object arbitrarily, so for example you can make a cylinder or cone object have an elliptical cross section. Although GlowScript supports the Classic VPython ellipsoid object, you can also make an ellipsoid simply by setting the size  (or length, width, and height) of a sphere object appropriately. Of course you can take advantage of the HTML/jQuery capabilities of the GlowScript browser environment to create rich web pages, and optionally export a VPython program to your own web site.</p>
<p class="Normal">Note  that color, like pos and size and axis and up in Classic VPython, is a vector in GlowScript, so that red, green, and blue are the x, y, and z components of color.</p>

<p class="Normal">Salvatore di Dio demonstrated in his RapydGlow experiment<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://salvatore.pythonanywhere.com/RapydGlow" target="_blank">http://salvatore.pythonanywhere.com/RapydGlow</a>)<br />
  how he was able to use the RapydScript Python-to-JavaScript compiler with GlowScript graphics. This inspired the implementation of the VPython (vpython.org) API at glowscript.org.  He provided the file papercomp.js for operator overloading, based on the work of<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jürg Lehni (PaperScript: <a href="http://scratchdisk.com/posts/operator-overloading" target="_blank">http://scratchdisk.com/posts/operator-overloading</a>).<br />
  He also assembled support for operator overloading and the ability to write synchronous code  in the file transform-all.js, based on the work of<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno Jouhier (Streamline: <a href="https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs" target="_blank">https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs</a>), and<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marijn Haverbeke (Acorn.js: <a href="https://github.com/marijnh" target="_blank">https://github.com/marijnh</a>).<br />
  Supporting the VPython API in a browser is possible thanks to the work of<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander Tsepkov (RapydScript: <a href="http://www.rapydscript.com/" target="_blank">http://www.rapydscript.com</a>) and<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Law (browser-based RapydScript: <a href="https://github.com/charleslaw/RapydScript_web" target="_blank">https://github.com/charleslaw/RapydScript_web</a>).</p>
<p class="Normal">When the GlowScript project was launched in 2011 by David Scherer and Bruce Sherwood,<br />
Scherer implemented operator overloading and synchronous code using libraries existing at that time. In 2015 it became necessary to upgrade to newer libraries because compilation failed on some browsers</p>
