Note: After installing nodejs, on Windows you must copy node.exe into the build-tools folder.

This description of how to build GlowScript is written in terms of the original build program, now named build_original.py. 
A more sophisticated build program is build_cli.py contributed by Iblis Lin, which may not be up to date.

There are now two different procedures to handling versioning:

1) Deploy the development version to the website.  
You can do this without worrying too much if you haven't changed ide.js or run.js; 
it can only break programs that have "GlowScript 0.4dev" and that is expected.  
You do this by just pushing the "deploy" button in GAE (Google App Engine) launcher.

2) Release a new packaged version - assume it is 0.4.  
This should normally be done after a little experimentation 
to make sure that 0.4dev is ready for prime time.  
The steps are the following:

In ide/ide.js, update parseVersionHeader.defaultVersion; after 0.4 is released, it would read:

parseVersionHeader.defaultVersion = "0.4"
    parseVersionHeader.defaultHeader = "GlowScript " + parseVersionHeader.defaultVersion
    // Map each version that can be loaded to a packaged version (usually itself), or 
    // "unpackaged" if it is the current development version
    parseVersionHeader.okVersions = {
        __proto__: null,
        "0.3": "0.3",
        "0.4": "0.4",
        "0.4dev" : "0.4",
        "0.5dev" : "unpackaged",
    }
    
and the defaultVersion would change to "0.4".

The defaultVersion has the same run time behavior as "package", 
but also is the default version encouraged by the editor hints and by new program creation.

Also in ide/ide.js, in the section pages.share, adjust the output of program export;
for example, GlowScript version 2.2 uses the same verdir value as 2.1 for jquery etc.

In untrusted/run.js, update choice of jquery library.
Add to css/redmond a folder with the new name if necessary (sometimes no change is needed)

Modify build_original.py and property.js to have version = "0.4" and
   run it to create the final packages for 0.4.  
Then change build.py and property.js to have version = "0.5dev" and save build_original.py, 
so that the 0.4 package doesn't get overwritten by accident.

If you're just fixing a bug in 0.4, all you need to do is Deploy from the Google App Engine Launcher,
to update the package files produced in the previous step that involved build.py and property.js.

There is a Glowscript program in build-tools/Symbols.js which you need to copy into (presumably local) 
glowscript and run to compile the symbols.  
You have to copy and paste the results into the appropriate file (package/symbols.X.Y.min.js).

You also have to change ide/index.html to point to the new Symbols file, 
since the IDE doesn't yet dynamically load symbols based on the version header.

Also change “Welcome to GlowScript X.Y” appropriately in ide/index.html.

There is a jquery version reference in untrusted/run.html.

There is a reference to version number in ide/api.py upgradeProgram().
Not clear that this is ever used.

At some point hopefully the build process will be more automated 
(using node to run this and other javascript parts locally).

Ideally we should create a branch "version-0.4" in the repository at this point, 
in case we have to come back and patch an old version for some critical bug.  
This has not actually been done so far.

************************************************************************************
    UPDATE library files in AWS/S3: https://s3.amazonaws.com/glowscript/package/
    UPDATE library files in the GlowScriptOffline package and create zip file
    UPDATE the glow library used in VPython 7; generate it with build_original_no_overload.py
    (This includes vectors_no_overload.js instead of vectors.js.)
*********************************************************************************************

Deploy in GAE launcher; note that at this point property.js should have version 0.5dev.

Test that version 0.3 programs still work, that version 0.4 programs work, 
that 0.4dev programs give an error, that 0.4 is the default version for a new program, 
and that 0.5dev programs work.

Update examples to use version 0.4.
